Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my Python-based Admin Portal for Fee Management! This project was a fantastic learning experience, and Iâ€™m proud to share it with you all. ðŸ’»âœ¨
What Does It Do?
This portal is designed to help admins efficiently manage user details and communicate with users based on their fee payment status. Hereâ€™s what it offers:
âœ… Admin Login with OTP Verification: Secure access for admins using OTP sent via email.
âœ… Edit User Information: Admins can update fee payment statuses (e.g., pending or cleared).
âœ… Send Emails: Automated emails can be sent to fee-pending users (reminders) and fee-cleared users (acknowledgments).
âœ… User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive menu-driven options for seamless navigation.
Tech Stack
Python 3.x for the backend logic.
External libraries like feepending, feepaid, and otp for email and OTP functionalities.
A structured dictionary to store and manage user details.
Why This Project?
This project was a great way to combine my passion for problem-solving and coding. It taught me how to:
Implement secure login systems using OTP.
Work with dictionaries and loops for efficient data management.
Automate email notifications for better user engagement.
